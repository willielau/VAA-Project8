title: "Insights into Government Procurement"
---

Welcome to our project website for ISSS608 Visual Analytics & Applications where we will be deriving insights into government procurement.

GeBIZ encompasses the public sector\'s request for quotations and tenders within the procurement procedure set out by Ministry of Finance. Records of Government Procurement via GeBIZ between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2022 are available on data.gov.sg. In this project, we aim to categorise the products or services from the raw text provided by GeBIZ, thereby generating powerful insights on government procurement.
