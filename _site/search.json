It encompasses all the public sector's request for proposals, quotations, and tenders which suppliers can easily search for and download relevant information packages, and thereafter submit their bids electronically.  \nThere is a huge amount of data collected on past procurements since GeBIZ's launch in 2000 which in turn becomes a valuable source to generate powerful insights into government procurements. This treasure trove has not been widely explored or utilized (at least publicly) and through a R Shiny application, we seek to explore meaningful insights that can aide anyone looking into government procurements, be it the government agencies themselves, the suppliers keen on participating in government tenders, or even a member of the general public with an interest to see one facet of how tax dollars are spent.\nGroup 8: Eda Chang | Wang Kunrui (Olivia) | Willie Lau"

For example, a project management company may be required for a large-scale project. The Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) code is used to identify industry. \n\n\n\nExplore any bias in terms of frequency of using the same supplier that could highlight a need to investigate if this is with or without good reason. \n\n\n\nExamine trends in the peak and troughs of procurements in each agency to see if there is any truth in the hypothesis that organizations tend to spend more liberally at the end of the budget period.  \n\n\n\n\nIt seems that there is a business intelligence tool named GeBIZ Insight that exists but it is either entirely an internal tool or for some other reason cannot be publicly found anymore.  \nOther previous works include an earlier ISSS608 class project in 2018 which provided network visualization between ministry, agency and supplier. The visualization supported inter- and intra- agency opportunities for information sharing and bulk negotiation with suppliers. A potential challenge to previous use case may arise due to variances in product or service and project size.  \nTo enrich ministerial / agency understanding of opportunities, this project will approach the dataset from the perspective of products and services. In addition, we look to enrich the procurement data with ACRA information on industry classification and paid-up capital. This will enable the public and corporate bidders to understand any other underlying relationship between the successful bidder and project type. It will also be interesting to see if the insights generated 5 years ago have changed since the world has drastically changed with the COVID pandemic and other global events. \n\n\n\nData will be drawn mainly from data.gov.sg and supplemented by GeBiz portal and Singapore Government Directory. We will extract the open tenders put out by government agencies from years Jan 2017 to March 2022. The main dataset will consist of 7 columns such as tender description, awarded date, awarded amount, supplier and agency information. We will also be extracting 'ACRA Information on Corporate Entities' from data.gov.sg to supplement supplier's information on industry classification (Primary SSIC code & description) and paid-up capital.  \n\n\n\n\nThe interactive dashboard will be split into 3 sections where users will be recommended to go through the sections sequentially.  \n1. Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nMerge Procurement data and ACRA information on corporate entities \nInsert procurement category as stated in GeBiz website into 2022 Procurement data \nPareto Charts to show which procurement categories account for 80% of total government procurement spending \nTrendline for the different procurement categories and what is the trend of the value awarded \nWordcloud / Named Entity Recognition to identify what kind of services or goods are often procured by different ministries \nTreemap to breakdown the ministries spending by procurement categories and/or types of services/goods to identify top expenditure \n\n2. Inferential Analysis\n\nANOVA to highlight any significant differences in mean for tenders by year/product/service/agency \nPredictive forecast of procurement spending by product / service \nTime-series analysis to explore the relationship between calendar year period and volume/value of awarded contracts \n\n3. Cluster Analysis\n\nNetwork Analysis of the different ministries/agencies vs suppliers to investigate their connectivity and any strong links or bias \nSankey diagram to show flows of ministries/agencies, suppliers, procurement categories and value \nDecision Tree  \n\n\n\n\nThe software used for this project is R, and the R packages that will be applied for the dashboard application are: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackages \nPurpose \n\n\n\n\nShiny and Shiny dashboard \nTo build interactive web application and visualisations \n\n\nSpacyr \nTo tokenize and tag common product or services \n\n\nTidyverse \nTo tidy up and manipulate the data \n\n\nPlotly \nTo create interactive graphs \n\n\nggplot2 \nTo create static graphs \n\n\nknitr \nDynamic report generation with R \n\n\nggstatsplot \nTo create graphics with details from statistical tests \n\n\nvisNetwork \nTo create network visualisation"
