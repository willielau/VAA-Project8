    "text": "Government Electronic Business (GeBIZ) is Singapore Government’s one-stop e-procurement portal, created to facilitate transparency in procurement requirements, procedure, and evaluation. Purchases can either be centralised (ministries and government agencies will then purchase off service-wide contracts) or decentralised.

In this project, we aim to categorise the products or services from the raw text provided by GeBIZ, thereby generating powerful insights on government procurements. This treasure trove has not been widely explored or utilized (at least publicly) and through a R Shiny application, we seek to explore meaningful insights that can aide anyone looking into government procurements, be it the government agencies themselves, the suppliers keen on participating in government tenders, or even a member of the general public with an interest to see one facet of how tax dollars are spent."

    "text": "Problems\nWhile the database of historical tenders is extensive, it is not organized or visualized in a manner that allows for patterns or insights to be easily derived without having some knowledge of data analytics methods and applications.\nTherefore, our R Shiny application seeks to address this and deep dive into the areas including but not limited to:\n\nCategorizing the records from its current raw text form; identify goods or services which are required by the government. This is crucial to enable practical use of the dataset by any user group.\n\nExamine and forecast time-series trends in procurement spend; is there any truth in the hypothesis that organizations tend to spend more liberally at the end of budgeting period?\nIs there any difference in GeBIZ procurement during the Covid period (identified as April 2020 to March 2022 by the Auditor-General’s Office), when emergency procurement procedures were utilized?\n\nThe dataset from GeBIZ is limited in scope; expand the scope beyond the seven variables\n\nEnrich the dataset by labeling the Ministry which each Government Agency belongs to\nEnrich the dataset with additional information on the supplier (i.e. primary industry, paid-up capital)\n\nExplore any bias in terms of frequency of using the same supplier that could highlight a need to investigate if this is with or without good reason."

    "text": "Relevant Related Work\nIt seems that there is a business intelligence tool named GeBIZ Insight that existed but it is either entirely an internal tool or for some other reason cannot be publicly found anymore.  \nOther previous works include an earlier ISSS608 class project in 2018 which provided network visualization between ministry, agency and supplier. The visualization supported inter- and intra- agency opportunities for information sharing and bulk negotiation with suppliers. A potential challenge to previous use case may arise due to variances in product or service and project size.  \nTo enrich ministerial / agency understanding of opportunities, this project will approach the dataset from the perspective of products and services. In addition, we look to enrich the procurement data with ACRA information on industry classification and paid-up capital. This will enable the public and corporate bidders to understand any other underlying relationship between the successful bidder and project type. It will also be interesting to see if the insights generated 5 years ago have changed since the world has drastically changed with the COVID pandemic and other global events."

We will extract the open tenders put out by government agencies from years Jan 2017 to March 2022. The main dataset will consist of 7 columns such as tender description, awarded date, awarded amount, supplier and agency information. We will also be extracting ‘ACRA Information on Corporate Entities’ from data.gov.sg to supplement supplier’s information on industry classification (Primary SSIC code & description) and paid-up capital."
